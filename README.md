# TeamMash

Here I have implemented the Elo Rating Algorithm. So the idea is taken from the very popular FaceMash/Hotornot. Instead of ranking people we are ranking different football clubs. UI is minimal.

### Dependencies ###

Make sure to include following jars.

* JSON jar
* mysql-connector-java jar


### Backend ###

Create your mysql database with the name "TEAMRATING". Import the csv file into a table named "mytable".
Compile and run the Posthandler.java .

Makesure to include all the jars.

### Frontend ###

Run the Frontend over an apache server.
